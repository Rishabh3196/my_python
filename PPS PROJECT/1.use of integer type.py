# PROGRAM # use of integer
a = (3 / 4)
print("a = ", a)     # OUTPUT =  QUOTIENT
b = (3 % 4)
print("b = ", b)     # OUTPUT = REMAINDER (% also known as MODULUS operator)
c = (3 // 4)
print("c = ", c)     # OUTPUT = Round the result down to nearest whole number
                     # for eg: 0.1==0, 0.9==0 , 2.75==2 , 2.1 == 2
d = (3 * 4)
print("d = ", d)     # OUTPUT = MULTIPLICATION
e = (3 ** 4)
print("e = ", e)     # OUTPUT = a ** b == a ^ b
